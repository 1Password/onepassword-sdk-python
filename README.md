## Requirements

The 1Password Python SDK is compatible with:

- `python` 3.9 or later
- `libssl` 3
- `glibc` 2.32 or later

If you're running a Linux distribution that still uses `libssl` version 1.1.1, such as Debian 11 or Ubuntu 20.04, you'll need to update to a later version of Linux or install the required dependencies.

## ðŸš€ Get started

To use the 1Password Python SDK in your project:

1. [Create a service account](https://my.1password.com/developer-tools/infrastructure-secrets/serviceaccount/) and give it the appropriate permissions in the vaults where the items you want to use with the SDK are saved.
2. Provision your service account token. We recommend provisioning your token from the environment. For example, to export your token to the `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN` environment variable:

   **macOS or Linux**

   ```bash
   export OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN=<your-service-account-token>
   ```

   **Windows**

   ```powershell
   $Env:OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN = "<your-service-account-token>"
   ```

3. Install the 1Password Python SDK in your project:

   ```bash
   pip install onepassword-sdk
   ```

4. Use the Python SDK in your project:

```python
import asyncio
import os
from onepassword.client import Client

async def main():
    # Gets your service account token from the OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN environment variable.
    token = os.getenv("OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN")

    # Connects to 1Password. Fill in your own integration name and version.
    client = await Client.authenticate(auth=token, integration_name="My 1Password Integration", integration_version="v1.0.0")

    # Retrieves a secret from 1Password. Takes a secret reference as input and returns the secret to which it points.
    value = await client.secrets.resolve("op://vault/item/field")
    # use value here

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())

```

Make sure to use [secret reference URIs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/secret-reference-syntax/) with the syntax `op://vault/item/field` to securely load secrets from 1Password into your code.
