The v0.1.2 release of the Python SDK brings:
* Support for item tags. You can now create, get, and edit tags within your 1Password items using item CRUD functions.
* Support for fetching one-time password codes using secret references. You can now fetch your TOTP code with the `secrets.resolve` function, using a secret reference for the TOTP field in your item. For example: "op://vault/item/field?=attribute=totp"
* PyPI wheels for the Python SDK. You can now install the Python SDK via `pip install onepassword-sdk`
* Full support for optional values. You no longer have to manually set `details: None` or `section: None` when instantiating `ItemCreateParams`.
* Item creation now only requires specifying the vault ID, item category, and item title.
