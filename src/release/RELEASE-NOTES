# 1Password Python SDK v0.3.0

## NEW

- **Support for item states**: You can now fetch an item's state using the SDK. `Item` and `ItemOverview` expose two states: `Active` and`Archived`.
    - `Active`: An item located inside a vault. (Default)
    - `Archived`: An item that has been moved to the Archive. 1Password doesn't include archived items in search results or suggest them when you fill in apps and browsers. You can keep archived items as long as you'd like.
- **Filtering the return of item listing by state**: You can now filter the listed items by item state. The current exposed filter is `ByState`, which allows devs to filter `ItemOverviews` by their `State` .

## IMPROVED

- **Improved Deleting Capabilities:** You can now delete `Archived` items in the SDKs.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES ⚠️

This release contains a breaking change for the Go SDK.

`items.list_all()` has changed to `items.list()` and below is how to migrate.

Before:
```python
overviews = await client.items.list_all(vault_id)
# To iterate through this you can do the following:
async for overview in overviews:
        print(overview.ID)
```

After:

```python
overviews = await client.items.list(vault_id, ItemListFilter(
                content=ItemListFilterByStateInner(
                    active=active,
                    archived=archived
                )
            ))
# to iterate through it you can do the following:
for overview in overviews:
   print(overview.ID)
```
`vaults.list_all()` has changed to `vaults.list()` and the migration guide is below:

Before:
```python
    vaults = await client.vaults.list_all()
    async for vault in vaults:
        print(vault.title)
```

After:
```python
    vaults = await client.vaults.list()
    for vault in vaults:
        print(vault.title)
```

*  All functions that return an Iterator will now return the appropriate list type.
