# 1Password Python SDK v0.4.0b2

## NEW

- **Vault group permission management operations:** You can now grant, update and revoke group access to vaults using `grant_group_permissions`, `update_group_permissions`, and `revoke_group_permissions` functions.
- **Desktop App integration on Windows:** The SDK can now authenticate via an authorization prompt from the 1Password app on Windows as well. Now all major desktop OSs support this feature.

## FIXED

- **Vault listing with additional parameters:** `vaults.list` no longer errors when additional parameters are provided.
- **Handling locked 1Password app state:** When the 1Password app gets locked after the SDK client is authenticated, it will now automatically re-authenticate.
