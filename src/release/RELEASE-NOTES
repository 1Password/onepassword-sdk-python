# 1Password Python SDK v0.2.1

## NEW

- **`CreatedAt` and `UpdatedAt` item metadata:** Items and item overviews now expose attributes with their creation and last edit times.
- **Resolving secrets in bulk**: With the `client.secrets.resolveAll` function, the SDK is now able to resolve multiple secrets at once, improving the performance of the operation.

## IMPROVED

- **Support for new field types:** Items with `Address` and `Date` fields can now be created, retrieved, and edited using the 1Password SDK.
- **Item sharing for attachments and documents**: Items with files attached now can also be shared using the `client.items.shares` functions.
- **Adding custom fields in sections automatically**: The SDK now automatically adds custom fields without a section to an empty section within the item, creating it if necessary.
- **`Tags` in item overviews**: The return type of `items.listAll` now also contains the item tags.
- **Broader item editing capabilities**: You are now able to use the `items.put` function on more items, including those with fields that are not directly editable through the SDK (such as legacy fields, passkeys etc.)

## FIXED

- **Improvements to resolving secret references:**
    - Archived items are no longer used for secret references.
    - When multiple sections match a section query in resolving secret references, the SDK look through the fields in all sections, instead of erroring.
