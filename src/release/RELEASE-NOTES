# 1Password Python SDK v0.3.0

## NEW

- **Support for item states**: You can now fetch an item's state using the SDK. `ItemOverview` exposes one of two states: `Active` or `Archived`.
    - `Active`: An item located inside a vault. (Default)
    - `Archived`: An item that has been moved to the Archive. 1Password doesn't include archived items in search results or suggest them when you fill in apps and browsers. You can keep archived items as long as you'd like.
- **Filtering listed items by state**: You can now filter the results of the item list function by item state.

## FIXED

- **Deleting Archived Items:** The SDK now supports deleting items from the archive.

## ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES ⚠️
This release contains breaking changes for two functions in the Python SDK.

**Vault listing**

* The function name has changed from `list_all` to `list`. To use this in your code, replace:
```python
vaults = await client.vaults.list_all(vault_id)
```
with:
```python
vaults = await client.vaults.list(vault_id)
```

* The return type of the vault listing function has changed from `SDKIterator[VaultOverview]` to `List[VaultOverview]`. To use this in your code, replace:

```python
async for vault in vaults:
    # using vault overview
```
with:
```python
for vault in vaults:
    # using vault overview
```
**Item listing**

* The function name has changed from `ListAll` to `List`. To use this in your code, replace:
```python
overviews = await client.items.list_all(vault_id)
```
with:
```python
overviews = await client.items.list(vault_id, ItemListFilter(
                content=ItemListFilterByStateInner(
                    active=True,
                    archived=True,
                )
            ))
```

* The return type of the item listing function has changed from `SDKIterator[ItemOverview]` to `List[ItemOverview]`. To use this in your code, replace:
```python
async for overview in overviews:
    # using item overview
```
with:
```python
for overview in overviews:
    # using item overview
```

This does not affect any code that's already deployed, and will not take effect in your codebase until you choose to update to version 0.3.0 or later of the 1Password Python SDK.
