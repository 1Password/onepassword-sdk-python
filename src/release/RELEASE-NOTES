# 1Password Python SDK v0.1.6

## NEW
* Support for item sharing: You can now create an item sharing link via the 1Password SDKs using the new `client.items.shares` API.
* Support for item archiving: You can now move items to the archive with the SDKs, using the new `client.items.archive(vault_uuid, item_uuid)` function.

## IMPROVED
* Support for item notes: You can now read, create and edit items with a notes field, accessing it via `item.notes`.
* Support for SSH key attributes in secret references: You can now retrieve an SSH key's public key, key type and fingerprint with `client.secrets.resolve`.
* Support for additional field types: You can now read, create and edit items with Email (email addresses) and Reference (ID references to other 1Password items) type fields.
* Type hinting: When developing with the Python SDK, the functions now show type hints on their parameters and return types.

## BUGS
* Improved field matching logic for secret references: Retrieving a field from the item's default field section is now possible even if there is an identically named field in one of the item's named sections.
